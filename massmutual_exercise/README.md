# Practice Exercise:
## Problem 1

### Objectives:
1. Need to verify the right count of values appear on the screen
2. Need to verify the values on the screen are greater than 0
3. Need to verify the total balance is correct based on the values listed on the screen
4. Need to verify the values are formatted as currencies
5. Need to verify the total balance matches the sum of the values
* Create a mockup of what the results would look like assuming all steps passed 

### Observations:
* Objective 3 and 5 are same, so validated at the end only (overall 4 scenarios).
* Total Balance value provided is incorrect, so total balance check scenario fails 
* Noticed that in element ids sequence number 3 was skipped. Assuming it is a typo, I created my mock page with correct element ids.

#### Note:
I am including result html in git repo for review.
